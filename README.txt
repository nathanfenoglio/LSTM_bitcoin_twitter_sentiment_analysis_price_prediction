Twitter sentiment has been found to more successfully indicate the direction of Bitcoin price in comparison to news releases for non-cryptocurrency currencies. We have implemented Natural Language Processing (NLP) to examine how Bitcoin values can be estimated from public opinion.
Our approach is developed in Python using the Polyglot NLP library, an LSTM (Long Short Term Memory Model) for model training and tested on manually gathered datasets.
